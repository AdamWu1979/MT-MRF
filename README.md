This repository contains all MATLAB code necessary to reproduce the results presented in the manuscript “Magnetization Transfer-Mediated Fingerprinting” - submitted to MRM.

The scripts required to generate figures in the paper are named according to each figure number. Other scripts are functions required for these files to work - please also add these to your MATLAB path. Other plotting functions may be included here and meet the necessary copyright requirements. This code is distributed under the MIT license. If you find these scripts useful, please cite our publication once available.
